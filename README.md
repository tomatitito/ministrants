A Clojure library designed to deal with data produced by the [Anglican Probabilistic Programming System](https://probprog.github.io/anglican/index.html). Mostly for extracting and plotting stuff from the output of a probabilistic program and for plotting. For plotting, I rely on [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) through [oz](https://github.com/metasoarous/oz).
